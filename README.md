# ICT-2016-2017 [![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-@iDoppioclick-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://t.me/iDoppioclick)
Repo where I'll put all files of the 2016-2017 ICT's lessons.

### General Infos
I will put the files divided in folders, renamed by the dates of the works.
Inside these folders there will be the files and a small .txt file, where I'll put textually what we've done.

### Repo clonation
If (for some akward reasons) You want to clone the repo on your server, You just only have to do these commands:

    $ git clone github.com/iDoppioclick/ICT-2016-2017.git
    $ cd ICT-2016-2017
